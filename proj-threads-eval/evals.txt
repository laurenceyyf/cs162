Aaron John|154|20|Aaron worked on and completed the Strict Priority Scheduler portion of the design doc. He also did all the corresponding coding and did extensive testing and debugging for this portion. His contribution to the priority scheduler is critical to the entire project because many other functions rely on the correct implementation of the priority scheduler. Aaron's commitment ensured the priority scheduler functioned well with the rest of the code. Without his effort, it would have been hard to test the functionality of the rest of the code. Aaron’s effort is roughly the same as my partners’, and his part is about one-quarter of the entire project, so this is why I think Aaron deserves 20 points.
Raj Thota|189|20|Raj was responsible for the User Threads portion of the project with Tony. He worked on both the design and implementation of the pthread syscalls. Beyond his solid work on the design doc, he also implemented the core pthread syscalls code. He did extensive testing and debugging to ensure his code functioned correctly. In addition, he wrote out two concept check questions in the design doc. His contribution to the project is evident. Since the pthread syscalls part is about half of the User Threads portion, I think Raj should receive the same amount of points as Tony.
Tony Nguyen|321|20|Tony was involved in coming up with design ideas and coding for the User Threads portion of the project. He mainly worked on the lock and semaphore. He made a significant contribution to the design doc and answered one concept check question. Additionally, he also did extensive testing and debugging with Raj on the User Threads portion. His hard work ensured his code functioned properly with Raj’s implementation on pthread syscalls. Tony's involvement in the User Threads portion is profound, so this is why I think I should give 20 points to Tony as well.
