Aaron John|154|21|Aaron worked on and completed the Subdirectories portion of the design doc. He also worked on the coding and did testing and debugging for this portion with Tony. The Subdirectories portion is important because this portion is required with Extensible Files to pass the persistence tests. Aaron's commitment ensured all the dir syscalls worked properly and we could thoroughly test on persistence tests before the deadline. Aaron’s effort is roughly the same as Raj’s, and he did more work on the design doc than Tony, so this is why I gave Aaron 21 points.
Raj Thota|189|21|Raj was responsible for the Buffer Cache portion of the project. He worked on both the design and implementation of the buffer cache. The Extensive Files portion calls buffer cache functions so his contribution is critical to the rest of the project. He did extensive testing and debugging to ensure his code functioned correctly. In addition, he wrote out two additional tests. His contribution to the project is evident. Since the Buffer Cache part is about the same work as the Subdirectories portion, I think Raj should receive the same amount of points as Aaron.
Tony Nguyen|321|18|Tony was involved in the coding for the Subdirectories portion of the project. He made a significant contribution to the debugging of this portion and ensured the dir syscalls worked properly. He also did some testing and debugging with Raj and Aaron on the persistence tests. In addition, he worked on the reflection of the final report. Since Tony did slightly less work than Raj and Aaron, I decided to give him fewer points.
